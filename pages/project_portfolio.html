            <h1>Building the portfolio site</h1>
            <h2>My thought processes</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The first thing I need to keep in mind when building a site is the goals and intention of the site.</p>
                <p>I asked myself questions like:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>What is the goal of this site?</li>
                <li>What do we want to say?</li>
                    <li>What do we want to show?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>but before we can be broad, lets narrow down what is necessary.</p> 
                <p>Any portfolio site would need:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A home page</li>
                    <li>A contact section</li>
                    <li>An about Me section</li>
                    <li>Some kind of gallery or way to present my work</li>
                    <li>maybe a blog or area to put ideas?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If I know I need these for a portfolio then let me narrow down what the goal of each of these pages is.</p>
                <p>A home page:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>should introduce myself</li>
                <li>A brief biography</li>
                <li>Outlining my main skills and services</li>
                <li>suggestion to contact</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is a good starting point and I can build from here once I set up the basics.</p>
                <p>How am I going to do this?</p>
                <p>You can't perfect anything before your foundations so I don't need to focus on making it pretty or flashy...</p>
                <p>I probably just need my name and what I would call myself professionally:</p>
                <blockquote>Ibrahim Aouli | Software Engineer & Analytics Specialist</blockquote>
                <p><i>I still don't know what to call myself but I know that these are 2 of the many fields that I am interested in learning.</i></p>
                <br>
                <p>A brief biography:</p>
                
                <blockquote> I am an innovative software engineer with many interests and expertise. I have worked with various tools and technologies and have a background in Game Development & Digital Analytics.</blockquote>
                 <blockquote> I excel in communication and programming and I also have many hobbies that I explore including gaming, watching anime, swimming and exploring nature, teaching piano and arabic, religion and foods and many more.</blockquote>
                <br>
                 <p>outlining my skills:</p>
                <p>I am probably gonna have some cards that outline categories like web development, game development, analytics, sofware / mobile?</p>
                <p>each one of those cards will probably have some text outlining topics or projects or interests.</p>
                <p>I could potentially put a little button to get in contact with me near my biography in a casual way like "Let's talk" or something. Otherwise I can have a button or some kind of way to move them to the contact page.</p>
                <p>That about does it for the preparations for home page. I am gonna build that with my next commit.</p>
