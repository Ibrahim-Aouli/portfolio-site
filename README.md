# portfolio-site
The goal of this repository is to try and create a site that will show off as much skills as I can and provide a good sample of who I am professionally.

The content I want to try and build are as follows:
- A home page that summarizes and provides a simple overview of myself.
- An about me page that talks about my interests and personal information I am happy to share.
- A gallery / collection page that houses many links to my projects and the ability to view detail about each one.
- A collection of pages showing off specific things, ideas and content.
- A contact me page to give people the ability to contact me through the means I want them to.
- A blog like area to just talk about ideas, make comments or add my personal thoughts on what I think are valuable.
- A todo / interest page that shows what kinds of things I am interested in learning in the future presented in various columns.
